## üöÄ About Me
Data Scientist Enthusiast | Full Stack Developer |  Petroleum Engineer Graduate | Solving Problems Using Data

Data is today's fuel. The sheer power of data drove me to initiate my journey into the mysterious world of Data science.

Like many others, my initial interest lay in web development, and I still continue to design websites for personal use. But for a student whose favorite subject continues to be Mathematics, I realized my passion upon switching to Data Scientist. 
Data Science has been my major point of interest for a year now, and my zest lies majorly in Machine Learning. I find ease coding in Python, but I never limit myself to learning Python just for Data science.
